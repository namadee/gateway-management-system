# Tech Venturas Gateway Management Portal

Tech Venturas Gateway Management Portal is a web-based solution built using ReactJS framework that allows users to manage gateways and their associated peripheral devices. The solution includes features for displaying gateway information, adding, editing, and deleting gateways and devices, as well as validation and error handling based on the provided REST API.

## Features

- **Display Gateways:** Users can view information about all stored gateways, including their unique serial number, human-readable name, IPv4 address, and associated peripheral devices. Pagination is not available as per the given APIs.
- **Add Gateway:** Users can add gateways by filling in a form that includes fields for gateway serial number, name, IPv4 address, and associated peripheral devices. The AddGatewayForm component handles form submission and validates the input fields based on the requirements provided. If any field marked as "to be validated" is invalid, an error is displayed to the user.
- **Edit Gateway:** Users can edit existing gateways by clicking the "Edit" button on the GatewayTable. The EditGatewayForm component pre-populates the form with the current gateway data, allowing users to update the fields and submit the changes.
- **Delete Gateway:** Users can delete gateways by clicking the "Delete" button on the GatewayTable. The GatewayTable component sends a delete request to the backend server to remove the gateway from the system.
- **Add Device:** Users can add peripheral devices to a gateway by filling in a form that includes fields for device UID (generated by the backend), vendor, and status. The AddDeviceForm component handles form submission and sends the data to the backend server.
- **Validation and Error Handling:** When storing a gateway or adding a device, the input fields are validated based on the requirements provided. If any field is invalid, an error is displayed to the user with the specific validation error message.
